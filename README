NOTE: My fork also works for /var/satellite directory where spacewalk stores the rpms. 
No need to clone them to a locally-held yum repository as you need to with the original centos-errata.py

NOTE2: If you are just setting up your repos, I suggest to use sha256 checksum and this fork here https://github.com/unreality/Centos-Errata/tree/
Mine is only meant to keep errata working with md5-checksum.

Big thx to David Nutter for coding the original !!

This tool will take a collection of postings from the "centos-announce" mailing
list. It can accept a digest, a decompressed pipermail archive downloaded from
the list archive pages[1] or use the Mail Archive site, convert the postings to
basic errata, upload them to a spacewalk server and publish them to a named
channel which contains the relevant update packages.
